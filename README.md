# :sparkles: B4 App :sparkles:
This is Alex Wang's Shiny App for Assignment B4 of STAT545. This app was made to be an interactive interface to examine the Drivers of Forest Loss in Brazil Legal Amazon (Tyukavina et al. 2017) dataset, available in the OWID Dataset Collection Github repository (https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets). The map depicting the Brazil Legal Amazon is from  MÃ¼ller-Hansen et al. 2017.

This app allows you to filter the data by year and by specific driver of deforestation. The first tab welcomes the user and gives a brief overview of the functionality of the app. There is also an image of the Brazil Legal Amazon to show the user the region of interest. In the second tab, the raw data is displayed as an interactive data table. In the third tab, the data is plotted as a histogram, highlighting the distribution of forest area lost by each forest loss driver per year.
