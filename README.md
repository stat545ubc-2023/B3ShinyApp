# B4 App :sparkles:
This is Alex Wang's Shiny App for Assignment B4 of STAT545. This app was made to be an interactive interface to examine the Drivers of forest loss in Brazil Legal Amazon (Tyukavina et al. 2017) dataset, available in the OWID Dataset Collection Github repository (https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets).

The app can be accessed here: . :grin:

This app allows you to filter the data by year and by specific driver of deforestation. In the first tab, the raw table is displayed as an interactive data table. In the second tab, the data is plotted as a histogram, highlighting the distribution of forest area lost by each forest loss driver per year.
