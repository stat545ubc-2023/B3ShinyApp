# B3 Shiny App
This is Alex Wang's Shiny App for Assignment B3 of STAT545. This app, B3 Shiny App, was made to be an interactive interface to examine the Whale Catch dataset, available in the OWID Dataset Collection Github repository (https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets) in the Whale catch (Rocha et al.; IWC) file.
\
\
Using the sidebar, the app allows you to filter the whale catch counts by year, and selectively display whale species of interest. It is interactive, and you can search within the data using the search bar, choose how many entries you want displayed, and reorder the counts to your liking. Additionally, if you wish to download any data of interest, the download file below the table will allow you to do so.
