# B3 App :sparkles:
This is Alex Wang's Shiny App for Assignment B3 of STAT545. This app, B3 App, was made to be an interactive interface to examine the Whale Catch dataset, available in the OWID Dataset Collection Github repository (https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets) in the Whale catch (Rocha et al.; IWC) file.

The app can be accessed here: https://abwang28.shinyapps.io/B3App/. :grin:

This app contains more than three features, but the first three features are denoted in the code's comments (Features 1-3). In the sidebar, the app allows you to filter the whale catch counts by year, as well as selectively display whale species of interest. The table is interactive, using the DT package, and you can search within the data using the search bar, choose how many entries you want displayed, and reorder the counts to your liking. Another feature included is a download button, so it is possible to download the data of interest.
